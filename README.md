## 🌟 Overview

**Operation-E** is one of our most ambitious **research & coding projects**.  
It is a **serious game** designed to teach children ecological habits in a fun, interactive, and immersive way.  

🎯 The goal:  
- Make **ecology accessible** to children  
- Translate complex issues into **playful missions**  
- Combine **science, pedagogy, and computer science**  

This project combines **game development (pygame)**, **multimedia integration (moviepy, custom music & assets)**, and **research on pedagogy & education**.

Operation-E was born from a **research-driven question**:  
👉 *How can we effectively teach ecological habits to children in a way that is simple, fun, and memorable?*  

We observed three key challenges:  
- 🚸 **Children are not sufficiently sensitized to ecology** in traditional education.  
- 📖 Explanations are often **too complex or abstract** for young audiences.  
- 🎮 Few engaging games exist that truly connect **scientific knowledge** with **child-friendly gameplay**.  

Our approach combined **pedagogical research** with **computer science & game design**.  
- We analyzed how **habits like recycling, saving water, and energy efficiency** are usually taught.  
- We adapted these into **mini-games and missions** with immediate feedback and rewards.  
- We tested different **narratives, visuals, and mechanics** to ensure the lessons stick.
